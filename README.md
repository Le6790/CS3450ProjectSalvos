CS3450 Spring 2018 Team Project

Problem Statement:
With the multitude of a wide variety of video games on the market, there a scarce amount that focus on the survival strategy genre and appeal.  While the player themselves will not have their own character, there will be a group for them to take care of and ensure their survival during an apocalyptic world.  Our desire is to create an entertaining and unique game to enter the current gaming market.  This game will be unique by focusing on a survival strategy genre to last as long as you can in the environment, and offer the user a different experience and method of figuring out how to make their group survive.

Project Objectives:
This project will be mostly-focused on a single-player experience focused on keeping a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic setting alive.  Hazards will most of the time be other survivors or zombies, but can also be environmental dangers such as winter.  This will be a top-down real time strategy game where the player can individually select each survivor to control their movements and actions.  Certain features that are planned to be included will be an active pause, saving, algorithm for AI, pathfinding, combat, and survival components such as hunger, thirst, warmth, etc.

Stakeholders:
There can be multiple ways to start out, such as the type of group.  One group can be ex-military, another of random urban civilians, and a bunch of hics and doomsday preppers.  There can also choose a specific map or have a random one created.  It can possibly have the inclusion of multiplayer, either via other survival groups or the other being a “gamemaster” where they control environmental hazards.  The user may also input their own ideas into the game, being able to create their own maps in-game.

Project Deliverables: 
The end goal for this is to be a fun and entertaining survival strategy game.  The game will give users options to change settings, such as video and audio, to their liking.  In game, they’ll be able to set names and control the group of survivors.  They’ll be able to control the survivors actions, ensure their survival, or watch their demise.  The engine to be used will be Haxeflixel, a 2D engine that will support and be able to produce all our desired features into the game.
